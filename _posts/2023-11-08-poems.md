I have a passion for poetry. It is my way of venting, perhaps. I write about things that I notice. I write it in a way that they are lyrical yet imaginable at the same time. I've won quite a few prizes for writing poetry from my school and from societal function.

I used to write in this site called Poetizer. It was great, and it still is, except it's paid only now. I could get a subscription and write over there, but one without a subscription cannot see my poems. So that's why, I'm creating another jekyll site to store all my poems. I am still in the process of migrating poems, but I should be done soon. Please take a look and don't forget to leave your thoughts in the comments!
