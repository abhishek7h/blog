# Hey, I'm Abhishek Hari

I'm a passionate writer and poet. I like to immerse myself in words, occasionally in code, too. Also interested in AI, football and music. Iâ€™m also a columnist for [MTK News](https://mtknews.studio/author/abhishek)

I am fascinated by English literature, I love all aspects of it, but I have a special place in my heart for poetry. I have written a lot of poems and I like to be poetic, you could say. My inspiration to pursue poetry is the football commentator Peter Drury. His commentary gives me chills, he makes it sound like poetry. Thank you, Peter! (Here's a funny little story: So back in like 5th or 6th grade there was a history test, and one question was about a philosopher I think, and I literally wrote 'Peter Drury' as the answer. And guess what? The teacher gave me marks for it. I confronted my teacher saying "Are you sure that this is the right answer?" and she said "Almost, the spelling is wrong." I don't what happened after that but I look back to that moment and laugh a lot.)

I also love writing stories, and for that I would like to thank Jeff Kinney, the author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series. I absolutely love this series, it's literally my childhood. I've read most of his books at least 5 times, they're that good! He is the reason I got into writing in the first place. I've tried to write in Jeff's style during my early days as a writer, but I've developed my own style of writing, and that can be seen through my posts. Anyway, Thank you Jeff!
