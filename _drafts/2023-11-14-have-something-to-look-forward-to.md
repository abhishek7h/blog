I am lazy. We all are lazy at some point of the day. But it's not okay to just laze around, slopped in your couch, doom-scrolling. That's why, I make goals to look forward to. It is so damn simple, yet so damn effective. If I do this task, then it'll lead me to my goal. It's that simple!

For example:

- If you finish a task now, you can relax later.

- Reogranzing your phone's homescreen will lead you to be more productive, which in turn, will help you complete your long time goal.
